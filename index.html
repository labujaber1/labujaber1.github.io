        <p> my name is Lawrence and I am a newly graduated computer science student aspiring to be a software developer.

            many spreadsheets and word documents. The data is a record of other's performance and includes achievement awards. 
            Encompassing this into a single desktop tool is the objective and keep data local so a database such as sqlite3 
            will most likely be used. The interface will be designed closely with the client as will the required methods of output.
            Its in the final round of price negotiation with the client with September anticipated as a reasonable live test date.

                    <p> The purpose of this tool is to provide a single place for a student to record resources 
                        collected for an academic piece of writing. Resources are used and referenced within 
                        an assignment and can be collected from either an e-source, such as webpages or e-books,
                        or a physical source, such as books or journals. Storing them in a static document or 
                        excel file can be used but is often difficult to sort alphabetically or by subject 
                        type to use when comparing them.

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p> Storing these resources in a database provides the user with enough space and organisation
                        potential to use this for all assignments in each module of any level academic course. 
                        To keep it simple for the user a connection string to a SQL server can be constructed and
                        use the windows username and password to authorise a connection. The string is editable
                        once created to add a username and password if required. A copy of the script to create
                        a simple three table database is included to help with the database creation.

                        ID number or group resources by category which are then displayed in the bottom table.
                        The category is used to group resources and is entered and controlled by the user for each new resource.

                        that can be referred to without going back to the original source. A button is included for 
                        the user to keep track of the total characters used but an error message will appear when 
                        saving if this is exceeded or fields are missing data. An example is also shown which is 
                        used as a description of the assignment rather than a resource. It is possible to write a 
                        large portion of an assignment to then be copied to a document and finalised for submission.

        <div class="title"><p id="p6">Network Configuration Scriptor - NWConfigScriptor</p></div>
        <div class="text-container">
            
            <p> This tool has been developed from a need to reduce the repetitive typing of learned network commands 
                when a learner is configuring routers and switches in a network topology. It can be used on directly 
                connected devices, virtual devices in GNS3, and in a limited capacity for Packet Tracer. Similar to 
                the first project a menu is used as a container for a user to open an instance of each required form 
                using a singleton design pattern.  
            </p>
            <div class="imageCase pp" ><img src="pics/NWMainMenu.jpg" alt="Main menu image" ></div>
            
        </div>
        
        <div class="text-container">
            <p> A script containing a set of network configuration commands can be created from template text files stored 
                in a designated folder. The template files are accessed and the contents displayed in the left of the 
                display for the user to select and begin constructing a script file to the right. Each template file can 
                include notes for the user's reference by using a ? to precede them. The command script is created in an 
                editable display for the user to add additional data required after a set command such as an IP address or 
                password. Show commands can also be included as reference and displayed in a separate readonly text box. 
                The user has full control and access rights to the template files for amendment. </p> 
            <p> Once a script is created in the editor it can then be saved to a text file or copied and pasted directly to 
                the command line of a network device. A folder is included to store these files but again the user has full 
                access rights to store them elsewhere. Right clicking in the editor will display a menu with additional 
                options such as opening a help file, append the script to an existing file, copy/paste, and file saving. 
                The terminal software putty is included for the user to copy the commands to a directly connected device. 
            </p>
            <div class="imageCase pp" ><img src="pics/NWCreateScript.jpg" alt="Create script image" ></div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="text-container">
            <p> A script can also be delivered to a device using a telnet connection. Whilst this does require the setup of 
                a device with username, password, ip address, and telnet access enabled, it acts as another method of 
                delivery. This is intended to extend a learners ability and exposure to configuration procedures outside 
                of a virtual environment. The readonly display on the right shows the retrieval of the devices command line
                for the user to assess if each command sent was correct. If a command was incorrectly entered by a spelling
                mistake for example the connection will continue and not produce an error report as is the design of a 
                telnet delivery. 
            </p>
            <div class="imageCase pp" ><img src="pics/NWTelnetScreen.jpg" alt="Telnet image" ></div>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p> The tool has been extended further to include a method of running configuration file backup and restore. 
                Using a telnet connection and a server TFTPD64 included copy running-config commands are sent to a device. 
                Retrieved configuration files can be selected and displayed for viewing or editing for advanced learners. 
                The running-config files are chosen rather than a startup-config file to minimise the effect of 
                configuration errors.
            </p>
            <div class="imageCase pp" ><img src="pics/NWTFTPScreen.jpg" alt="TFTP image" ></div>
            <p> The tool has been written in C# and used the .NET windows forms framework. Each form is fully decoupled 
                allowing for each method to be extracted and used separately elsewhere by any learner. The telnet 
                connection is in a separate class and called in the telnet and Tftp forms. The front end design was chosen
                as effective means of displaying separate forms in a single display thus reducing screen space. </p>

            <p> The game as the title and image infers is a two player online and offline 2D Java 
                racing game based on the client-server model and multithreading. A server is hosted 
                and players connect sending messages using the TCP protocol. The first connected 
                player is established as player 1 by the server but requires both players to connect 
                for the race to start. Messages are sent to establish the game start parameters and 
                updated car positions, displayed in a readonly communications display to the right 
                of the application. The game ends when either player completes 3 laps and is 
                congratulated with an image displayed in the center console and a hearty cheer. </p>
            <p> The game includes collision detection where the speed is reversed to enact a bouncing 
                effect. Sound effects are also included as are separate key controls for each car and 
                a choice of two tracks.

            <p id="p8"> Word Guessing Game (cheat) </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p> This is a Python console word guessing game based on hangman but without the graphics. The 
                computer is the controller and the player tries to guess a word from a loaded dictionary 
                and randomly selected word length. The word length is in the range 5 - 12 and the player 
                gets double the chosen length in guesses. There is a hard or easy mode for the player to 
                choose and an option to end the game after each play otherwise there is no limit on game 
                play.
            </p>
            <p> The computer does cheat a little, instead of selecting a single word at the start the 
                computer filters the dictionary list according to length of word and each letter guessed. 
                The computer calculates the total words for each filter criteria and selects the collection 
                according to parameters of the easy or hard modes. The aim for the computer is to have more 
                than one word remaining in the bank when the player reaches the end of their guesses to 
                guarantee winning the game.
            </p>
            <p> The easy approach is to select the largest bank of words from each filtering sequence 
                whilst the hard level uses a scoring method to select a bank with the least common letters 
                found in the provided dictionary.
            </p>
            <p> An additional calculation is made and applied to the random word length selection to slightly 
                reduce the probability of larger word lengths selected. The larger the word the more guesses 
                given so this just adds a further sprinkling of favour in the computers direction.
                A step too far?
