                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    The following project is a redesign of an existing static wordpress business website. It is 
                    done using the Django framework utilising the inbuilt SQLite3 database and administrator system. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intention was to extend the learning made during a degree web development module where the Django framework was used
                    instead of React to create an e-commerce site. Using a real web site as a base provides the incentive to add value to the 
                    project and simulate a real world use case rather than create a direct copy of a site. The project was not meant to be 
                    a commercial endeavour but was developed as if it was one.

                                <p class="card-text">This website was chosen to develope as it is old and does not contain anything other than a contact number, some text, and images.
                                    There is no dynamic interaction or social media contacts and does not appear to be regularly updated. Searching for 
                                    the business social media presence reveals facebook as the method they use to update followers of news and inventory
                                    making the website redundant as a business asset.
                                </p>

                                    This presents many opportunities to both learn how to add value to the site and learn the power of Django for the 
                                    front and limited back end. Whilst it is common for a commercial project to use React for the front and Django for the back,
                                    this project uses Django for both. Bootstrap5, custom CSS, and javascript are used for styling. Almost all the content
                                    is stored in the in built SQLite3 database which is served dynamically to each page, if it exists, using placeholders 
                                    and loops. The content is administered from Django's built in admin system and acts as a CMS template for a business 
                                    advocate to use. The only two things that the site creator would need to change is the google maps link and several parallax
                                    background images set in css.

                                    This plug can be changed in the admin system to a different message as it may encourage a user to leave the website earlier than intended.
                                    While this type of information is intended to be helpful to a user and extra advertising for the business, designers try to deter users from 
                                    early exit and so place this content type away from the main site position on a page. As a short parallax section acting a section divider
                                    its impact is intended to be minimal. This UI consideration can be extended to evaluate the value of having social media icons in nav bar as

                                    Like the inventory these are using bootstrap5 cards model. The code to populate the cards are layered to include a header,
                                    an image from the database, a title, a more (collapsable) section, and social media attribute buttons. The collapsable section 
                                    can contain an external image using a url, a video, and text content. Evaluating their facebook account shows a business representative
                                    attending a car show which the url image could point to for example, and videos showing vehicles loaded for transport and delivery. 
                                    Giving them the ability to add multiple media types could enhance the news card for the audience and further indorse the abilities of
                                    the business to provide a trustworthy and professional service. Each card is dynamically produced as well as each content so no space is

                                    typically provide. Comments are left anonymously as no user account is setup for visiters but does not display until the business advocate 
                                    moderates them. A reply to a comment can be made by the business advocate and naturally displayed when the comment is authorised for view.
                                    A tally counts the comments authorised rather than submitted and awaiting moderation. 
                                    Likes are automatically added to the likes tally count, and the share links takes the user to the chosen account on a new browser page.
                                    The dislike ability has not been included as it is unnecessary. 
                                    Since all visiters are anonymous the ability to comment and like on a specific news card is governed by the session and only allows it once. This does not
                                    prevent a user from closing the session and opening a new one to add another comment or like. It would not be in the best interest
                                    of repeated visitors to limit comments to each news card so using ip addresses for example is not necessary. A message does pop up to 
                                    inform the user that a comment or like has been successful or they have already done one.
